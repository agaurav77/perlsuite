|   MINITEST-PERL5.20.2   |
+-------------------------+

This directory has tests for Perl5. These were picked up from Perl 5.20.2, 
some files were removed (those which tested features we're not interested 
in right now) and some were modified to let the tests work in general for 
any system which has shell support, and perl installed. Please note that 
these tests are neither up to date, nor include features present in a 
current day Perl build. On a system other than NaCl, the working of these 
tests guarantee that the perl working on your system is much better than 
just having miniperl, but not as good as complete core build of Perl5.
